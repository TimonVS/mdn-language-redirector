Ever had to switch the language on MDN because it wasn't in your preferred language? I had to do this all the time because Google would direct me to the Dutch version of MDN. With the MDN Language Redirector extension for Chrome you will always browse MDN in your preferred language.

## Install

- [Chrome extension]()
- Firefox add-on (coming soon)
